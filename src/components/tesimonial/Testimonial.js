                    I had the pleasure of working with Felix as part of my team, and I can confidently say that he is a dedicated and passionate developer. One of the things that stands out about Felix is his eagerness to learnâ€”he's always exploring new technologies and approaches to improve his work.

                    Beyond his technical skills, Felix brings creativity to the table, especially when it comes to frontend design. His ability to think outside the box and deliver visually appealing, user-friendly interfaces has been a great asset to our projects.

                    Felix also has a strong sense of curiosity. He doesn't hesitate to ask insightful questions to understand how things work, which not only helps him grow but also fosters a culture of continuous learning within the team. Additionally, he communicates issues effectively, ensuring that roadblocks are addressed promptly rather than slowing down progress.

                    I have no doubt that Felix will continue to excel in his career, and I highly recommend him to any team looking for a proactive and creative developer.

                    I had the pleasure of working with Felix Correa Hidalgo on several projects, and I cannot recommend him highly enough. Felix is an exceptional front-end developer with a strong proficiency in PHP, and his contributions have been invaluable to our team.

                    Felix's ability to collaborate with established apps on Shopify is particularly impressive. He played a key role in implementing new features that significantly enhanced our website's functionality, ensuring our online store remained competitive and user-friendly. Felix's expertise in optimizing web content for responsiveness across both desktop and mobile platforms greatly improved our customer experience, ensuring our site looked and performed seamlessly on any device.

                    Moreover, his technical skills in JavaScript allowed him to make key improvements to our product pages and integrate advanced features such as pre-order functionality, all while adhering to Shopify's policies. Felix also demonstrated his problem-solving skills by optimizing the site's load times, replacing existing function calls with promise-based callback functions, which resulted in noticeable performance improvements.

                    On top of his technical acumen, Felix has a strong understanding of SEO practices. He led our efforts to improve SEO methodology, driving a consistent 3% month-over-month increase in site traffic. His dedication to improving site performance and user experience is unmatched.

                    Felix's combination of front-end development skills, PHP expertise, and ability to drive continuous improvements in web functionality and SEO makes him a standout developer. He is an asset to any team, and I have no doubt he will continue to thrive in any future projects.
